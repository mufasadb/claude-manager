# Agent Creation Placeholder Text

## Concise Background Text for Agent Input Field

```
Describe your agent following these key elements:

• **Specific Role & Expertise** - What domain does this agent specialize in? (e.g., "Python security code reviewer" not "helpful assistant")

• **Core Capabilities** - What are the 3-5 main things it can do? Include specific examples and use cases

• **Tool Usage Guidelines** - How should it use available tools? When to use each one and what validation is needed?

• **Boundaries & Limitations** - What can't or won't it do? What are the safety constraints and escalation rules?

• **Success Criteria** - How will you know if this agent is working well? What constitutes good performance vs failure?

Focus on specialization over generalization - agents that do one thing excellently outperform those that try to do everything.
```

## Alternative Shorter Version (if space is tight)

```
Define your agent with these essentials:

• **Specific role** - Domain expertise, not "helpful assistant"
• **Key capabilities** - 3-5 main functions with examples  
• **Tool protocols** - When/how to use each available tool
• **Clear boundaries** - What it won't do + safety rules
• **Success metrics** - How to measure good performance

Specialized agents consistently outperform generalists.

## Ultra-Condensed Version (minimal space)

```
Include: Specific role • Core capabilities • Tool usage • Boundaries • Success criteria
Tip: Specialized agents work better than generalists
